# Run DFOH experiments

This folder contains the code to run the DFOH experiments. To be able to execute the code, you will need some extra dependencies.

## Requirements

### Docker Images for DFOH
To execute the experiments, you must first build the Docker images associated with the DFOH project. We provide a script that automates the cloning of the necessary repositories and the building of these images:

```bash
./dfoh/script.sh
```

### Database
DFOH experiments rely on historical data, which can be quite large. There are several ways to acquire this data:
- You can use the [project](https://forge.icube.unistra.fr/tholterbach/dfoh_database) provided by the authors to collect the data. This will take a lot of time.
- You can scrape the data from [their website](https://dfoh.info.ucl.ac.be/database).
- You can ask the authors for a copy of the data.

Once you have the data, remember to set the folder in the `config.py` file.

## Usage without DB
Running DFOH without database is not possible. We provide an example of the data generated by the attacks in `./dfoh/data`.

With that you will be able to run the plotting functions:

```bash
python main.py dfoh plot hijack
python main.py dfoh plot blame
```
